Almost every organization has to deal with planning problems to perform its business operations. Whether its transporting goods from a warehouse to stores, assigning employees to shifts, inspecting and servicing vehicles, or allocating tasks to departments, the more efficient and effective these tasks can be performed, the bigger the competitive advantage of an organization will be

In this workshop you will be introduced to OptaPlanner/Business Optimizer, Red Hat's A.I. Constraint Solver. OptaPlanner provides advanced A.I. heuristic algorithms that, combined with a domain model and constraint rules, allows organizations to find optimal solutions to their planning problems.

In this third lab, we introduce the OptaPlanner Benchmark. You will be introduced to the various heuristic algorithms that OptaPlanner provides, and you will write a benchmark that will test the various algorithms on your _Cloud Balancing_ solver application.

**Topics covered:** OptaPlanner, Planning Problems,Heuristic Algorithms, Benchmark
