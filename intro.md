# Introduction

**What you will learn:**

Almost every organization has to deal with planning problems to perform its business operations. Whether its transporting goods from a warehouse to stores, assigning employees to shifts, inspecting and servicing vehicles, or allocating tasks to departments, the more efficient and effective these tasks can be performed, the bigger the competitive advantage of an organization will be

In this workshop you will be introduced to OptaPlanner/Business Optimizer, Red Hat's A.I. Constraint Solver. OptaPlanner provides advanced A.I. heuristic algorithms that, combined with a domain model and constraint rules, allows organizations to find optimal solutions to their planning problems.

In this second lab, we will start implementing our optimization constraints. We will explain the different constraint types, like hard and soft constraints. We will show different types of score calculators and show their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, you will implement the constraints of our _Cloud Balancing_ solver, the application we've built in the previous lab, in both Java and Drools.

**Topics covered:** OptaPlanner, Planning Problems, Constraints, Score Calculator
